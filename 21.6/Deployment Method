The actual traderbot will be deployed through my linode server to ensure constant internet access, and will access the trading market using the 
cbpro (https://pypi.org/project/cbpro2/) API and my gdax account. 

Models used for both the trading and the prediction algorithm will be updated using transfer learning on my local machine and pushed the server on a weekly basis
to maintain model accuracy.
